# Python Final Project
Since the original project folder size is over 389 MB, I decided to only include the most important files that I wrote for the project. 
Please watch the following [video](https://youtu.be/eioQrgQ-jO4) showing an overview of the project. The slideshow used in the video is also included in this repo.

# File Structure
The following is the order of the files executed when running the program (which is demonstrated in the video above):
1) The graphical user interface (GUI)
   - gui.py
   - gui.kv
3) "Start Program" Button in GUI
   - ur5e.launch
4) "Pick Red/Green/Orange" Buttons in GUI
   - planning_execution.py (with color passed as an argument)
5) "Ready Robot" Button in GUI
   - ready_robot.py

## UR5e Description
This folder holds all the files that describe the objects (Robot, camera, boxes, bins, etc.) used in the simulation. All the files are written in XML.

## UR5e MoveIt Config.
[MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/) is a ROS package that focuses on controlling robot manipulators. This folder holds all of the files that are automatically generated by the MoveIt package when a robot manipulator is defined. I did not write any of the files in this folder, but they are used and crucial for the program to run.  

## Motion Planning
This folder holds all of the files that deal with motion planning. It includes the GUI files, the scripts and service files for finding the object positions in the scene, and the files for controlling the robot manipulator's movements. These are the main files for the entire program, and almost all of them are written in Python.
